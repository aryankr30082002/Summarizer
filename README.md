# 📄 README: LLM Summarizer (Dual LLM Approach)

✨ Project Overview

The LLM Summarizer is a Python-based tool that leverages two Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize any webpage or raw text content. This dual-LLM approach ensures flexibility and robustness by allowing the user to choose between models based on use-case, cost, or performance.

🚀 Features-
✅ Summarize content via web URL or plain text input.

✅ Switch between two LLMs (e.g., Ollama & OpenAI GPT or others).

✅ Clean and human-readable summaries.

✅ Handles various text formats (articles, blogs, documentation).

✅ Graceful fallback if one LLM fails.

🏗️ Tech Stack
Python 3.10+

LLM 1: Ollama (Local, Open Source)

LLM 2: OpenAI GPT (Cloud API-based)

BeautifulSoup4 — For web scraping.

Requests — For HTTP requests.

dotenv — For API key management.

Streamlit/Jupyter (Optional) — For UI/demo purposes.

⚙️ Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/aryankr30082002/Summarizer/tree/main/Website_summarizer
cd llm-summarizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your .env file (for OpenAI):

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
📝 Usage
1. Choose LLM in Code:
python
Copy
Edit
from summarizer import summarize_text, summarize_website

# Use 'ollama' or 'openai'
summary = summarize_text("Long text here...", model="ollama")
print(summary)

summary = summarize_website("https://example.com", model="openai")
print(summary)
🔄 LLM Selection Logic
Model Option	Description	Use Case
ollama	Local, free, no API cost, faster for small summaries	Offline or budget-friendly summarization
openai	Cloud-based GPT (with API key)	When accuracy, creativity, or large content handling is required

🔍 How Tokenization & Context Window Matter:
Both LLMs use token limits.

OpenAI models: Context window 4K–128K tokens.

Ollama (local models): Depends on model config (typically 2K–16K tokens).

Very long text is auto-chunked to fit context limits.

⚠️ Limitations
Requires API key for OpenAI GPT.

Ollama model may require GPU/CPU resources.

Large documents might be split if context window exceeds.

💡 Future Plans
Automatic model selection based on input length.

GUI via Streamlit.
